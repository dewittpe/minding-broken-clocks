I have successfully defended my Ph.D. dissertation: "Parsimonious B-Spline
Regression Models via Control Polygon and Control Net Reduction for Identifying
Factors Explaining Variation in Daily Hormone Profiles During The Menopausal
Transition."

Only minor edits to make to the dissertation itself.  Several publications are
forthcoming.  You can get more info on the control polygon and control net
reduction methods from the R package cpr available on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=cpr" target="_blank"> CRAN </a> and/or
<a href="https://github.com/dewittpe/cpr" target="_blank"> github</a>.
