I presented a paper at the 10th International Conference on Health Informatics
in Porto Portugal, Feb 21-23, 2017.
[HealthInf](http://www.healthinf.biostec.org/) is part of
[BIOSTEC](http://biostec.org/).

The paper I presented was on the use of git submodules as a data security
solution for collaborative reproducible reporting. The focus was on using third
party hosting services and open source software to minimize financial
commitments and relying on institutional firewalls to limit access data
submodules.  

*Title:* "Collaborative Reproducible Reporting: Git Submodules as a Data
Security Solution," 

*Authors:* Peter E. DeWitt and Tellen D. Bennett, 

*Abstract:* Sensitive data and collaborative projects pose challenges for
reproducible computational research. We present a workflow based on literate
programming and distributed version control to produce well-documented and
dynamic documents collaboratively authored by a team composed of members with
varying data access privileges.  Data are stored on secure institutional network
drives and incorporated into projects using a feature of the Git version control
system: submodules.  Code to analyze data and write text is managed on public
collaborative development environments.  This workflow supports collaborative
authorship while simultaneously protecting sensitive data. The workflow is
designed to be inexpensive and is implemented primarily with a variety of free
and open-source software.  Work products can be abstracts, manuscripts, posters,
slide decks, grant applications, or other documents.  This approach is adaptable
to teams of varying size in other collaborative situations.

The paper itself will be published online as part of the BIOSTEC 2017
Proceedings, at
[Scitepress](http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/HomePage.aspx).

The conference was wonderful.  Great keynotes talks. For me, as a
bio-statistician, it was great to see other aspects of bio-informatics, sensing,
image analysis, process analysis, and translational research.

I also enjoyed visiting the city or Porto.  Great wineries, food, and views on
the river front.  A must visit.
