[The International Biometric Society](http://www.biometricsociety.org/) (IBS) held the
28th International Biometric Conference 10-15 July, 2016 in Victoria, British
Columbia, Canada.  I had submitted my some of my dissertation work to this
conference and gave an oral presentation:
_Parsimonious B-spline Regression Models via Control Polygon Reduction_.  The
talk was well received.  The International Biometric Society presented me with
the __Best Student Oral Presentation__ and the Western North American Region
(WNAR) of the IBS, which held its annual meeting in conjunction with the
conference, awarded me __Distinguished Oral Presentation__ as part of the
student paper competition.  

These award announcements were also printed in the Biometic Bulletin, vol 33. no.
3 July-September 2016.

Below, I am shaking hands with IBS President Elizabeth Thompson after being
awarded __Best Student Oral Presentation__.

B-spline transformations of continuous predictors are commonly used in
regression models to estimate a smooth non-linear relationship with the
response. The quality of the regression fit is subject to a knot sequence ξ.
Selection of a knot sequence is traditionally achieved by choosing between
regression models with a varying number of knots, which are placed at the
predictor quantiles. AIC or BIC are then used for model selection. It is well
known that AIC and BIC can result in big models (i.e. models with a large number
of internal knots). If parsimony, minimizing the number of interior knots n(ξ),
is important this approach is not desirable. Our goal is to develop an efficient
knot selection algorithm that selects models with smaller n(ξ) without
sacrificing goodness of fit.

Instead of focusing on likelihood maximization, we present a knot selection
method based on the geometry of the b-spline control polygons (CP). CPs have
been used extensively in computer aided graphic design and numeric analysis;
primarily for deriving and evaluating B-spline approximations to fit complex
shapes measured with little to no noise. Changes in CP provide a useful metric
for assessing the influence of a particular knot, which we demonstrate can then
be used for smart removal of knots.

Our control polygon reduction (CPR) algorithm starts with a CP based on an
initial ξ with large n(ξ) and knot positions on a fine partition of the
predictor. Inspired by Lyche and Mørken (1988), we assess the influence of each
knot on CP geometry and omit the knot exerting the least-influence on the CP
shape. After a knot omission, the model is refit with the coarsened knot vector.
The process continues until all internal knots are removed. The final regression
model is selected as the model with the smallest n(ξ) such that a single
additional knot has negligible effects on CP geometry.

We show that for a wide range of functional shapes, including complex
longitudinal hormone data, the CPR algorithm results in a final model with fewer
internal knots than models selected via traditional approaches and with
negligible differences in the sum of squared residuals. CPR is computationally
efficient and provides high quality fits built on low-rank design matrices. The
CPR algorithm is an attractive solution for knot selection in a wide range of
applications.
