<a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/Academics/departments/Biostatistics/Pages/welcome.aspx" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and Informatics</a>
has awarded me the **2017 Strother Walker Award** based on outstanding work on
your dissertation, and your many contributions to computational work being done
by your fellow classmates.

**Strother H. Walker award.**  This is given to an outstanding PhD Biostatistics
student who has completed the first year and passed the first written Qualifying
exam at the PhD level.  Preference is given to students who have passed the
second written Qualifying exam.  It is partially a cash award funded from the
interest on a trust set up by Dorothy Walker in honor of Professor Strother
Walker, the former chair of the Department of Biometrics.
