An R package Providing a conformal mapping of one 2D polygon to a rectangular
region via the Schwarz-Christoffel theorem.

Methods are provide to find a convex hull for an arbitrary set (x, y)
coordinates.  This hull, and the points within, are, via an (inverse)
Schwarz-Christoffel mapping, mapped to the unit disk.  A second
Schwarz-Christoffel mapping from the unit disk to an arbitrary rectangle is use
to finish the conformal mapping.

This package builds hulls via Andrew's monotone chain algorithm implemented in
C++. The Schwarz-Christoffel mappings are provided by the FORTRAN SCPACK by
Lloyd N. Trefethen.

**Not on CRAN** The FORTRAN code writes to the terminal directly.  It is
possible that when the FORTRAN code errors that the R session will be terminated
as well.  For these reasons the package does not pass CRAN checks.  My FORTRAN
skills are minimal, and it is a low priority, to fix this problem.  If you'd
like to help fix see [Issue #1](https://github.com/dewittpe/sccm/issues/1).
